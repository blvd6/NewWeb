  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Theodora Stavrou, and I am an 18 year old first year student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and Informatics at the Cyprus University of Technology.<p>
    <p>My passion for this field stems from a fascination with how technology can be optimized to address real-world challenges and enhance quality of life. I am particularly drawn to cybersecurity, where I
       aim to strengthen the security frameworks of digital systems and safeguard critical data against increasingly complex cyber threats. 
       However, I am equally enthusiastic about game development, as it combines technology and creativity to craft immersive digital experiences.<p>
      
      <p>What sets me apart is my proactive approach to learning and my ability to bridge theory with practice. I continuously expand my technical knowledge by exploring technologies, experimenting with operating systems like Linux, and searching into hardware concepts such as Raspberry Pi.
      These activities allow me to gain hands-on experience and apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. While I am still in the early stages of my learning journey, I am eager to develop my skills further and take on more complex challenges. 
      By combining creativity, logic, and innovation, I am committed to making a meaningful impact as a computer engineer. Whether in cybersecurity or game development, I aspire to optimize solutions and adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape.
      My passion for continuous learning and innovation positions me as a dedicated and forward-thinking individual, ready to tackle the challenges of the digital age.
